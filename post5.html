				The bakery design was hard for me, since it was my first time playing around with Photoshop for web design. Iâ€™m still facing challenges like alingnment and placement but I have improved since I first began. I was having problems with illustrator as well. There was a time when the logo I used got inverted and I could'nt fix that.

So how I fixed my design was by making it more simpler. This helped me improve the alignment and the messiness and hence the design.
