			I wanted to keep this design simple and fancy at the same time. I had no image so I used subtle patterns on  the header and as the background. The background pattern is different from the header. The header's "BLOG" matches with the text on left and "SAHIL" matches with the box on the right. This makes sense because the box containes all the post that "SAHIL" has written and the text on the left is the actual "BLOG". I also added 3-D type feel to the box.
