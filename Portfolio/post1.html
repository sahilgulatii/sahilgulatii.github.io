				I made this simple portal for a design class. I wanted to do something different so "misaligned" the link box. Now, the user  first sees the title (cuz it's huge) and then the tool box because the  background color is the same as the title and it is misaligned. So that it does not look like a mistake I added a shadow. For the buttons on left side I added a texture which surprisingly look decent. :P This Portal basically was an experiment which worked out quite well.
