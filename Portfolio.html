				After seeing the intro and my big name, I want the viewer the to notice the button "CONTACT ME" after that. I made the button translucent, giving it a nice whitish background with low brightness. It kind of blends in with the background. When the user hovers on it, the button slowly becomes solid and "CONTACT ME" changes to red. I think the hovered button looks nice because it matches the colours of the Coffee Mug's white and red. In the end, I made the links in the about section red to make it obvious that those are links and the highlight of my website. The user would definitly notice that after going to that section.
